libindi (0.9.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release to unstable.
  * Bump the libnova-dev build dependency to >= 0.14.0. (Not really needed,
    but makes sure it is built with an up-to-date libnova.)

libindi (0.9.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * It seems ABI is broken (new virtual method), so:
    - bump the SONAME to 0b (update patch abi.diff)
    - rename libindi0a to libindi0b
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.3, no changes required.
  * Switch copyright to copyright-format 1.0.

libindi (0.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - provides the fix by Nobuhiro Iwamatsu (thanks!) for compiling on SuperH.
      (Closes: #644456)
  * Update the patches:
    - destdir.diff: drop, applied upstream
    - fix-pkgconfig.diff: drop, applied upstream
    - format-security.diff: drop, applied upstream
    - libdir.diff: refresh, dropping the applied parts
  * boost is no more a dependency, so remove libboost-dev from the the build
    dependencies and from the libindi-dev dependencies.
  * libindi-dev: add dependency on libcfitsio3-dev, as cfitsio headers are
    included in public headers.
  * Update copyright.
  * Upstream does not keep a stable ABI while not bumping the SONAME, so:
    - bump the SONAME to 0a (patch abi.diff)
    - rename libindi0 to libindi0a
    - drop the symbols file of libindi, "replaced" by a tight shlibs
